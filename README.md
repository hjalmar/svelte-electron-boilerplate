# Svelte Electron Boilerplate

## Installation
Clone repository to get started
```
npx degit hjalmar/svelte-electron-boilerplate <app-name>
cd <app-name>
npm install
```
### Electron
NOTE: electron dev script relies on `nodemon` to listen for file changes. Instead of installing nodemon as a package install it globally with the `-g` flag.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
```
npm install -g nodemon
```

To run dev server. Execute following command in your terminal from the 
root directory 
```
npm run electron
```
or to launch electron with devtools open
```
npm run electron:devtools
```

### Frontend
To spawn frontend dev server simply cd into `frontend-app`, install and launch the dev script
```
cd frontend-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
Launching the electron build will first build the `frontend-app` before being packaged to an electron application.

From root directory. Execute following build script
```
npm run build
```

The build step is managed by the [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) library. To configure the build step, refer to it's documentation.

NOTE: Currently only windows configured out of the box.

## Frontend libraries used
This boilerplate is customized by me for me so and the reason why these packages is included by default.

### Your own frontend
If you want to change frontend-app simply make sure that your build output is pointed to `frontend-app/public` or make the neccessary changes in `electron/config.js` and the root `package.json` file.

To replace it with a blank svelte app, start by removing the contents of `frontend-app` and follow the instructions over at https://svelte.dev/ to install a blank template.

# Branding
Logos and icons used in this boilerplate is my personal brand. Use them as references to change to your own custom icons which are more suitable for your application.

# Support

Open source in all it's glory is amazing and I personally love to share the knowledge I've accumulated over my years programming 
and doing webdevelopment. A small tip helps greatly to incentivize having packages up to date 
and the tools and services sometimes needed to be able to do so. While it's 100% not required, if you find this project beneficial to you and your work, any contribution would be highly appreciated.

Additional support like bug reporting and feature requests are also highly encouraged. Do so in respective 
package repository that it may concern. Cheers!
